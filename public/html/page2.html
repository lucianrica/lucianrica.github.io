      <h1>Big Data, the new Death Star</h1>
      <img src="../img/death-star.png" alt="death-star">

      <p>Back in National College of Ireland where we learn the magic of computers, we try to discover what “big data”
        exactly means. I will invite some friends and we’ll set our ship’s course for a faster-than-light travel to an
        alternate state of existence adventure.
      </p>

      <p>So, starting our mission to find out what Big Data means I already got goose-bumps. It sounds so scary like I’m
        about to search and engage the Death Star war-machine from the famous movie Star Wars. To defend against such
        machinery, we’ll need the blueprints of it, so to understand big data we really need to look at "data" first.

      <h1>R2-D2: "Beep-bee-boop-bee-doo-weep”</h1>
      <img src="../img/r2d2.png" alt="r2d2 robot">

      <p>I’m asking R2-D2 to use his hologram system, zoom in and show all relevant bits of information<i> (R2-D2:
          Beep-bee-bee-boop-bee-doo-weep)</i>. Data represents our understanding of anything that we can count, weight
        and describe, in any shape or colour transformed into numbers. Numbers are like a parallel universe that always
        surrounds us. </p>

      <p>The world of mathematics gives us information to transform it into knowledge and knowledge makes us wise. It
        gives us the power of discerning and judging properly as to what is true or right. Let’s use our knowledge and
        set the hyperdrive to Big Data. <i>(Chewbacca: Aarrr wgh ggwaaah)</i>

      <h1>Into the Unknown</h1>
      <img src="../img/into-the-unknownn.png" alt="data">

      <p>Our technology allows us to collect, store and process huge amounts of data, everything is connected to
        internet, so-called internet of things. Millions of sensors across the globe allow us to read
        humidity,temperature, wind speed and so on. We take this huge mass of information and fine-tune it to visualise
        and understand complex systems like the weather.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this amount of data, we need some serious algorithms and self-learning machines. This service is available
        to anyone these days from home users to giant IT companies like Google and Microsoft, is it posible that we
        start building the Death Star technology and we don’t know it yet? <i>(Chewbacca: Aarrr wgh ggwaaah)</i>
      </p>



      <h1>The Dark Side</h1>
      <img src="../img/darth-vader.png" alt="darth vader">

      <p>We gave computers the power to learn, they will gain knowledge and become wise, just like us in the beginning.
        I’m scared that they will outsmart us and every thought we have will be choked by Darth Vader to match the
        empire’s algorithm. Are we still in control or is there some advanced algorithm that shape our decisions? Will
        big data bring balance to the force?
