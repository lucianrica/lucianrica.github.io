      <h1>Future of Electric Cars, no banana</h1>
      <img src="../img/minion-on-bike.png" alt="minion-on-bike">

      <p>You might be wondering why I feel great about my choice of college, two months into computer science at
        National College of Ireland and they already helped me discover that I enjoy blogging. It demands a fair amount
        of research and courage to speak your mind, but besides the possibility to get frustrated, it’s great fun.
      </p>

      <p>Anyhow, today we will synchronize with the future and download files of “The Future of Electric Cars”. So, I
        will jump in my pyjamas, take a sip of the hot reviving brew and let myself to be caught up in a fantasy of
        future cars and “Despicable Me” movie.
      </p>



      <h1>Gru: "Assemble the minions”</h1>
      <img src="../img/gru.png" alt="gru character">

      <p>An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using electrical energy
        stored in rechargeable batteries. At first, it seems so insignificant that we always think about the fuel, that
        is renewable and cheaper. But beneath the surface of the story, electric cars are more than the battle between
        green
        energy and fossil fuel, they embrace the most challenging visions of the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        They fight to prevent the destruction of our ecosystem, they embrace latest technologies like wireless systems
        to charge cars by simply pulling up in a parking space, internet connectivity, remote control apps, sensor
        information systems, and more. But I’m not here to reveal secret or confidential information, I here to
        investigate the future. <i>(“Gru: I'm going to need a dozen robots disguised as cookies”)</i>
      </p>



      <h1>Driving is the most complex action</h1>
      <img src="../img/driving.png" alt="minions driving a car">

      <p>Let's bite into a simple slice of future life, electric cars will always apply the latest technology possible
        to amaze their customers. Inspired by the tales of Machine Learning that has recently surfaced to mass media, I
        believe that they will love to own this piece of technology to create self-driving cars.
      </p>

      <p>
        Driving is maybe one of the most complex actions humans do every day. It involves dozens of decisions every
        second and we don’t even realise it. To program a machine to drive involves a lot of sensors and a lot of data
        to be processed. Is a tremendous amount of work for us to program artificial intelligence systems, ultimately
        machine learning will save the day, imagine if cars can learn on their own, like a human driver, to asses’ risk
        factors and anticipate an accident. <i>[the minions pull out their weapons]</i>
      </p>







      <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
      <img src="../img/minion-artificial-intelligence.png" alt="minion AI">

      <p>
        Artificial intelligence is a field of studying the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms.
        Basically, it’s a set of mathematical relations that uses logic and software to produce an output with our given
        specifications. These relations are like shortcuts to our problems, like instead of travelling from Ireland to
        France by car
        we’ll travel on a plane. The plane is an algorithm in this case. <i>(“Gru: Hey mom! I build a rocket based on
          the macarroni model!”).</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m confused myself even though I preaty good in math, atleast I though i was. To make it worse many learning
        algorithms generate complex models that are difficult for a human to interpret, debug, and extend. There is
        really no escaping from its influence and I am confident that cars will be equipped with these learning
        algorithms in the future. <i>(“Gru: [screams, holding a frying pan for protection] Where did you get that?”)</i>
      </p>



      <h1>So, no Bananna..</h1>
      <img src="../img/bannannna.png" alt="minions loving bannannna">

      <p>
        If we observe how technology comes together we can prophesy that personal cars will become history. Just think
        about it. Cars are expensive to buy, its already costing us too much to upkeep, and more cars on the road means
        more traffic congestions. Majority of the people probably use the car about 5% from the 24 hours given in a day,
        we go to work and back, shopping once a week and some random trips. But the rest of 95% is wasted time, just
        imagine you have a €40,000 piece of machinery doing nothing.
      </p>

      <p>Electric cars will use cheap fuel and will get cheaper if combined with other solar power and energy
        developments. It will be cheaper to rent driverless cars than to own. Just book your schedule for the day on a
        phone app and the car will drive us to our destination. What a beautiful world. <i>(“Gru: Someday, I'm going to
          go to the moon Ma. Gru's Mom: I'm afraid you're too late, son. NASA isn't sending the monkeys anymore.”)</i>
      </p>

      <p><i>From your faithfull minion, ...Bananna?, Para tu, Para tu</i></p>
