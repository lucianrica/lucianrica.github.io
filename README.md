### Be the Warrior:

> Mental strength comes from developing a mindset that enables you to face and overcome any challenge or adversity life throws at you. You're going to come across hard times at some point in your life.
>
> The second step in practicing the warrior mindset is to battle your code. If you’re working on a difficult problem, and can’t find a solution–find a way to persevere. Don’t quit. No matter how great the challenge, push through and do whatever it takes to win.
>
> The first step in achieving a warrior mindset is to understand that if you commit to something, you will do it–or you will die. There is no “try”. The most practical way to apply this mindset to your day-to-day programming life is to be very selective about the projects you work on.
>
> The way you approach challenges makes an enormous difference in the quality of your work. If you take a project lightly, and don’t fully commit yourself to working on it–you will always produce low quality software.
>
> Go make yourself awesome, than find someone who loves you for what you have, not someone who expects what you can be". You have to play the same quality card on yourself as you play it on any other project aswell, than you'll trully unify with a higher self.
